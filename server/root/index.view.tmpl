        I built this site mostly as a hobby. Yes, I am a big enough nerd to want to build a website on the weekends for fun.

            I'm a software developer specializing in the MEAN and Microsoft stacks. I'll keep my resume up to date when I'm actively looking for a job, but it may be out of date most of the time.
