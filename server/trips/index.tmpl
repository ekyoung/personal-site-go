                    This motorcycle trip took me 25,000 miles over about 10 weeks. I visited the Southernmost, Easternmost, Northernmost, and Westernmost points
                    in the lower 48 states, and the Northernmost and Westernmost road accessible points in North America. In addition to these bragging rights
                    points, I stopped at a lot of great sights along the way. I've included some pictures of the (better than expected) road conditions up North
                    for reference by other riders thinking of making the trip.

                    Sarah and I visited Playa del Carmen, Mexico to attend her friend Anne's wedding. While there we explored the cenote at Rio Secreto, Mayan
                    ruins in Coba and Tulum, and went snorkeling at Gran Arrecife Maya.

                    On this trip we visited Canyonlands and Arches National Parks. We toured around the Needles area of Canyonland on my motorcycle and saw the
                    few sights that can be reached by paved roads and short hikes. To see more requires travelling on moderate and difficult 4x4 trails. In Arches
                    we met up with some friends who were in town for a Nissan Xterra off road convention. After seeing a few of the popular sights from the paved
                    road we all got in the 4x4 vehicles and headed out to Tower Arch. This was one of the best sights and it was nearly deserted because of it's
                    slightly more remote location. I can't wait to go back and explore more of the world famous 4x4 trails in the area.

                    This open pit copper mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world. In the roughly 100 years since it has been
                    in operation, over 6 billion tons of material has been removed. For more information (and some better pictures) visit the

                    This park in the Uinta Basin is home to a dinosaur quarry where thousands of fossils
                    have been discovered. Most were removed and placed in museums around the world,
                    but around 2,000 remain encased in stone so that tourists can see them the way they
                    were discovered. Scientists think the bones are located here because dinosaur carcasses
                    were washed down river until they stopped on a sand bar and were burried with more
                    sand and silt to become fossilized.
